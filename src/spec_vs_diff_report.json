  "summary": "REQ-13 appears implemented in App.tsx by watching auth changes and forcing a valid signed-in hash (roleSelection) when the current hash is empty/invalid, while keeping the refresh/reconnecting overlay logic. REQ-12 is not evidenced: main.tsx was not modified to mount AuthProvider. Two non-requested documentation/state files were modified with broad unrelated feature descriptions.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Update frontend/src/main.tsx to mount AuthProvider from ./contexts/AuthContext around the entire application (preserving existing QueryClientProvider and InternetIdentityProvider wrappers) so useAuth() can update auth and the UI can transition beyond LoginScreen.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows only three modified files: App.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. There is no evidence that frontend/src/main.tsx was edited to add <AuthProvider> around <App />.",

    {

      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-12/REQ-13; the BuildRequest explicitly limits scope to fixing post-login navigation and mounting AuthProvider.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Updated a frontend file summary index with extensive claims about many screens/hooks and behaviors unrelated to the requested login-navigation fix (e.g., React Query hooks, multiple pages, PWA manifest/SW details).",
      "reason": "Not requested; this is additional meta/documentation change outside REQ-12/REQ-13.",
