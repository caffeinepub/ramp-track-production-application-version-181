  "summary": "App.tsx now derives the logged-out vs signed-in render directly from `auth` and preserves the reconnecting overlay across both states, but it still uses stored view state (`currentView` via `useState`) and a `switch(currentView)` to control navigation, which conflicts with REQ-10’s acceptance criteria. Additionally, files other than `frontend/src/App.tsx` were modified despite the constraint to modify only App.tsx.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Remove stored screen-selection React state (the `subView` `useState` and `setSubView`-driven switch) and replace it with a non-stale navigation mechanism, with no `useState`-backed view/screen state or `switch(subView)`-equivalent controlling navigation.",
      "reason": "The diff shows `currentView` being stored in React state via `useState` and a `switch (currentView)` used to select which screen to render, which is equivalent to stored view/screen state driving navigation.",
