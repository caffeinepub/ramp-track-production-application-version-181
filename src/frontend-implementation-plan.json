        "`frontend/src/App.tsx` no longer uses `useState` (or any other stored state) to track the current screen/view (e.g., no `view`/`setView` pattern for navigation).",

        "No splash-screen gating remains in `App.tsx` (e.g., no rendering `SplashScreen` and no effects that delay/timeout transition to login).",
        "No gating on readiness flags/timeouts remains in `App.tsx` (e.g., no `isAuthReady` checks; no timer-driven UI transitions that control which screen is shown).",
        "`AuthContext` is not modified.",
        "The app compiles successfully with only the change to `frontend/src/App.tsx`."
